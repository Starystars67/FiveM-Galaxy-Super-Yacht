# FiveM-Galaxy-Super-Yacht

This resource adds the galaxy super yachts to FiveM. It is in very early stages and only adds the one single yacht in the top left corner (Paleto Bay). There are no configuration files as of yet due to early stage of development so please check back soon for updates. 

Think you can help? Please do! PR's are welcomed!

Kind Regards, Happy scripting, Titch
